## 0.0.21

- Client resolve functions working again.
- Append module.hot.accept() automatically on Page files.
- Separated Segment registration and query subscription at ReduxStore.
- Hot-reload Segment and ActionCreator now works.
- DataComponent now assumes immutability on props and state, overrides
  shouldComponentUpdate() by default.
- DataComponent now uses componentWillReceiveProps() to update internal state
  with segment pieces.
- Simplified RenderType to just CLIENT and SERVER.
- Removed HydrationType, CLIENT subscription now *always* load data, while
  SERVER subscription *never* loads. Server hydration is done explicitly with
  Store.hydrate().

  client and server.

  - At SERVER, subscription doesn't load automatically.
